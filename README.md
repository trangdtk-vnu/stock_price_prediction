Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains implementations for predicting stock price movements, focusing on IBM stock. The prediction task is facilitated by three different architectures: simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS).

Repository Contents:
1. Functions Module (.py):
This file contains essential functions required for the stock price prediction task. It includes the implementation of a custom loss function designed specifically for predicting stock price movements, along with other utility functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more.
2. Python Script:
This script serves as the main entry point for conducting stock price prediction experiments. It utilizes the functions provided in the "Functions Module" to implement the prediction task using the RNN, LSTM, and ANFIS architectures.

By leveraging these components, others can easily explore and experiment with different approaches for predicting IBM stock prices as well as others.
